## Who Is This Program For?

This program is designed for children who need support to become school-ready:

- **Developmental delays** — behind peers in multiple skill areas
- **Mild autism spectrum** — needing structured preparation for mainstream school
- **Failed school admission assessments** — not yet meeting nursery/LKG criteria
- **Attention and behavior challenges** — difficulty sitting, following instructions
- **Self-help skill gaps** — needs support with toileting, eating, dressing

### Signs Parents May Notice

- Cannot sit and attend for more than 5 minutes
- Difficulty following simple instructions
- Not holding pencil correctly or avoiding writing activities
- Limited interaction with peers in group settings
- Struggles with self-care tasks other children manage
- Previous school suggested "try again next year"

## Core Goal

**Develop pre-academic, social, and self-help skills for successful school transition**

By the end of 6 months, children will demonstrate the attention, academic readiness, social skills, and independence needed to join mainstream nursery or LKG classes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Will my child definitely get into regular school after this program?**
A: Our program significantly improves school readiness. While we cannot guarantee admission (as schools have their own criteria), most children completing this program successfully transition to mainstream settings.

**Q: My child is already 5+ and has never been to school. Is it too late?**
A: It's not too late. We work with each child's individual timeline and help them catch up. Many children join school successfully at age 5-6 with proper preparation.

**Q: How is this different from a regular playschool?**
A: Our program is therapy-integrated and individualized. While playschools provide general exposure, we specifically target developmental gaps with specialized techniques and track measurable progress.

**Q: Can my child join mid-program?**
A: We recommend starting at Month 1 for the structured progression. However, after assessment, we may enroll children at appropriate points if they have some foundational skills.

**Q: Do you provide support for school admission interviews?**
A: Yes, we prepare children for typical admission assessments and provide parents with strategies for the admission process.

**Q: What if my child also has speech delays?**
A: Ready, Set, School! includes speech therapy (30% of sessions). If speech is the primary concern, we may recommend starting with "Little Talkers" first, or running both programs together.
