## Who Is This Program For?

This program is designed for young children who are:

- **Late talkers** — not speaking first words by 18-24 months
- **Limited vocabulary** — using fewer words than expected for their age
- **Unclear speech** — difficult to understand even by family members
- **Non-verbal or minimally verbal** — using gestures more than words
- **Slow language development** — not combining words by age 2-3

### Signs Parents May Notice

- Child points or gestures instead of using words
- Difficulty imitating sounds or words
- Limited response to verbal instructions
- Frustration when trying to communicate
- Preference for solo play with limited social engagement

---

## Core Goal

**Build foundational communication skills from first words to simple sentences**

By the end of 6 months, children will have a functional vocabulary, be able to express basic needs through words, and show improved social communication with family and peers.
