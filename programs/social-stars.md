## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does my child need an autism diagnosis for this program?**
A: No formal diagnosis is required. Any child with social communication challenges can benefit. We can also help guide the assessment process if diagnosis is being considered.

**Q: My child talks well but doesn't have friends. Is this the right program?**
A: Yes, this is exactly what Social Stars addresses. Many children have good vocabulary but struggle with the "social use" of language — pragmatics. We focus on practical social skills, not just speech.

**Q: Will my child be forced to make eye contact?**
A: We don't force eye contact. We work on natural, comfortable social attention. For some children, looking at the mouth or general face area works better than direct eye contact, and we respect that.

**Q: How do you handle children with very different skill levels in groups?**
A: Groups are carefully composed with children at similar developmental levels. We ensure all children can participate meaningfully and learn from each other.

**Q: My child prefers adults to other children. Will this program help?**
A: Yes, we specifically work on peer preference. Many children with social challenges find adults easier (more predictable), and we build bridges to peer interaction gradually.

**Q: What if my child has meltdowns during group activities?**
A: We proactively manage sensory and emotional needs. Children learn to recognize their regulation needs, and we have quiet spaces available. Meltdowns are handled with support, not punishment.

**Q: Can you coordinate with my child's school?**
A: Yes, we provide school coordination as part of the program, including strategy recommendations and progress updates (with your consent).
