## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does my child need an ADHD diagnosis to join this program?**
A: No formal diagnosis is required. If your child shows attention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity challenges, they can benefit from this program. We can also help with the assessment process if diagnosis is being considered.

**Q: Will this program replace medication?**
A: Our program is complementary to medical treatment, not a replacement. Behavioral strategies work well alongside medication or as a standalone approach for milder cases. We coordinate with your child's doctor.

**Q: How quickly will I see results?**
A: Some strategies show immediate effects (sensory tools, visual schedules). Lasting behavioral change typically becomes visible by Month 2-3 and continues to strengthen through the program.

**Q: My child's school is struggling with their behavior. Can you help?**
A: Yes, we provide school consultation as part of our program, including strategy recommendations, teacher communication, and coordination of approaches between home, school, and center.

**Q: Is this program only for hyperactive children?**
A: No, we also work with children who have primarily inattentive presentations (daydreaming, slow processing) and combined presentations. Strategies are tailored to each child's profile.

**Q: What happens at home if strategies don't work?**
A: We troubleshoot together. Strategies often need adjustment for home contexts. We provide ongoing support and modify approaches until we find what works for your family.
