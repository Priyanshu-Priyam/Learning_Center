## Who Is This Program For?

This program is designed for school-age children who experience:

- **Learning difficulties** — struggling with reading, writing, or math despite effort
- **Dyslexia indicators** — letter/word reversals, slow reading, decoding difficulties
- **Dysgraphia indicators** — poor handwriting, difficulty with written expression
- **Dyscalculia indicators** — difficulty understanding numbers, math concepts
- **Slow learners** — learning at a slower pace than peers
- **Academic struggles** — failing or barely passing despite attending school regularly
- **Low academic confidence** — "I'm not smart," gives up easily on schoolwork

### Signs Parents May Notice

- Reads very slowly or avoids reading aloud
- Confuses similar letters (b/d, p/q) or words
- Spells the same word differently each time
- Writes illegibly despite trying hard
- Struggles to remember what was just taught
- Takes much longer than peers to complete homework
- Says "I hate school" or "I'm stupid"
- Memorizes rather than understands concepts
- Difficulty following written instructions
- Behind grade level in reading, writing, or math

## Core Goal

**Build academic foundations using specialized, multi-sensory teaching methods**

By the end of 6 months, children will demonstrate improved reading, writing, and/or math skills appropriate to their level, along with effective study strategies and renewed confidence in learning.

## Homework Support System

### Setting Up for Success

**Physical Environment:**
- Quiet, dedicated study space
- Good lighting
- Organized materials within reach
- Timer visible
- Minimal distractions

**Routine:**
- Same time daily
- Snack and movement first
- Start with easiest subject
- Breaks every 15-20 minutes
- End with review of what was learned

### Parent Role During Homework

**DO:**
- Be nearby but not hovering
- Ask what strategies child can use
- Praise effort and strategy use
- Help break tasks into steps
- Allow productive struggle

**DON'T:**
- Do the work for the child
- Show frustration or anxiety
- Erase and require rewriting constantly
- Compare to siblings or peers
- Extend homework beyond reasonable time

### When to Stop

Set a homework time limit (per grade level):
- Grade 1-2: 20-30 minutes

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this like regular tuition?**
A: No, this is specialized remedial education, not homework help or syllabus teaching. We focus on filling foundational gaps using therapeutic techniques, not just covering school topics.

**Q: Will my child catch up to grade level?**
A: Every child's progress is different. Many children make significant gains. Our goal is to build foundations and strategies that help your child continue improving beyond our program.

**Q: My child already gets tuition. Why does this help?**
A: Regular tuition teaches curriculum content. Learning Launchpad addresses the underlying processing difficulties that make learning hard. Once these foundations are stronger, regular learning becomes easier.

**Q: Should we continue school tuition alongside this program?**
A: We recommend reducing tuition pressure during our program to avoid overwhelming the child. Focus on our strategies first; tuition can resume once foundations are stronger.

**Q: My child hates reading/writing/math. Will they still cooperate?**
A: We use engaging, multi-sensory methods that are often enjoyable. We start with success experiences to rebuild confidence. Most children who "hate" academics just need a different approach.

**Q: How do you coordinate with schools in Gorakhpur?**
A: We provide documentation and are happy to communicate with schools. However, schools vary in their willingness to accommodate. We also help parents advocate effectively.

**Q: Can you diagnose dyslexia or other learning disabilities?**
A: We provide detailed learning profiles but not clinical diagnoses. If formal diagnosis is needed, we can refer to appropriate professionals.
